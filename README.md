This project includes various media assets (such as music and sound effects) that were sourced from publicly available content on the internet, including YouTube.

I do not claim ownership of these assets, and all rights remain with their original creators.

If any asset owner wishes to have their content removed or properly credited, I will promptly comply with such a request.
